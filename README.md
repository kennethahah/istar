This software package implements iStar
(Inferring Supper-resolution Tissue ARchitecture by integrating spatial transcriptomics and histology),
which enhances the spatial resolution of spatial transcriptomic data
from a spot-level to a near-single-cell level.
The iStar method is presented in the following paper:

Inferring super-resolution tissue architecture by integrating spatial transcriptomics with histology.

The software package is written by Daiwei (David) Zhang
and is under active development.
The transformer codes are based on HIPT, and some utility codes are based on XFuse.
